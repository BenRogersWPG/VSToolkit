This toolkit was created to easily develop Hybrid Applications for mobile devices (on top of [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com))

The main features are:

* Objects oriented toolkit
* Framework driven by a component approach
* Works on mobile devices
  
  * Small memory footprint and memory deallocation
  * Performance (JS and Rendering)

The IDE [ViniSketch Designer (VSD)](http://www.vinisketch.fr/mainSite/en/product.html) is based on this toolkit for creating application.
